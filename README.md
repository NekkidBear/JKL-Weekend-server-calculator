# PROJECT NAME

Weekend Server-Side calculator app

## Description

Duration: weekend of 4/6

This is a simple web-based calculator app supporting addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. It takes two inputs (numOne and numTwo) and returns the result of the selected operation. 

For example, if you enter 1 and 4 in the fields, and then click the "*" button, you'll get the answer 4 when you hit the '=' button. You will also see a list of previous calculations.
